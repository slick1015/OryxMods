# Mod List

## DisableAnalytics
Disables DeltaDNA analytics for your privacy.

## DropNotifications
Notifies the player when a white or orange bag is dropped with a swirly effect and text notification.

Configuration file can be found in: `<game directory>/OryxMods/DropNotifications.toml`

TODO: include gif.

## FastStart
Changes to make the game launch faster. 

Currently only skips the splashscreen when the game is launched.

## LocalPlayerPrefs
Makes it so the game stores your settings in a file called `<game directory>/PlayerPrefs.json` rather than in the registry. 

Makes it easier to hand-modify settings like player opacity.
